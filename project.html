        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <h4>There have been a number of cloud storage services gaining prominence in the past several years, like Google Drive or Dropbox, but these services are generalized and better utilized for file sorting and sharing. Photo-sharing apps like Instagram and Pinterest have a narrower focus, but lean heavily towards the social media aspect and don’t provide high-quality photo storage and organization tools.</h4>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <h4>Muse focuses on high-quality photo storage that allows users to upload and organize multiple photos at once. You can curate collections, use tags to organize them, and share them easily with other people. They're photo books for the digital age.</h4>

        <h3>Research and Discovery</h3>
        <h4>The first step in this process was to gather crucial background information. I crafted a survey that would determine which cloud storage apps people used the most, what features the liked the best, and what their biggest frustrations were. I also wanted to gauge how interested people would be in a photo organization/sharing app, and collected responses from people across all genders, age groups, and professions.</h4>

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <h4>Out of all the cloud storage services on the market, Google Drive is the most cost-effective and has many native apps for creating content, such as Docs and Sheets. It also boasts robust real-time collaboration features, but since its launch, users have found the interface difficult to navigate. Dropbox is great for businesses and is better at integrating content from the web, but has fewer ways to create content and has also suffered from security concerns over the years. Finally, Pinterest has a much more visually-focused interface, but it's seriously lacking in collaboration tools and other organizational tools. </h4>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <h4>Going through this journey was a process and an extremely valuable experience for me as a designer. I learned a lot about the importance of each step of the process, especially the research-gathering phase. The research you do is the foundation of what you design, and the more information you gather, the stronger your foundation. <br><br>The most difficult part of this process for me was creating the high-fidelity mockups. I knew what feelings and messages I wanted to convey with my design, but I had trouble translating that into a tangible finished product. What I found was that it was easier to step away for a quick break and a mental refresh every so often, or look for inspiration in other places, instead of mulishly trying to push through it. Sourcing opinions from others with A/B testing and usability testing was also invaluable, and a good way to get back on track. <br><br>By being thorough in my background research and gathering the requisite information, I’ve positioned my product to fill a space in the current market. By going through several iterations of designing and collecting user reactions through multiple rounds of user testing, I’ve created an experience that is intuitive and easy for people to use. The care and attention I put into each step of the process ensures that Muse is the best solution for the problem.</h4>
