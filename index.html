        <h4>I didn’t know UX design was a career option when I started working three years ago at a medical software company. I was a software tester, and my job was to make sure not only that the software worked, but that it was “a joy to use”. Throughout my time there, there was a huge company-wide initiative to focus more on usability as a way to set us apart from our competitors. As a result, I worked more closely with our UX designers, which were in short supply, and took on a lot of the UX research for my individual projects. <br><br> The more I got involved with UX and learning core UX principles, the more fascinated I was. Going on work trips to various hospitals and watching cardiologists and technologists use the tools I helped make really impressed upon me the importance of good design, especially in a critical setting like the cath lab. <br><br>Suddenly, it clicked. Why not just become a full-time UX designer? That was already the most interesting part of my job. <br><br>Now, I love that I can indulge my analytical and problem-solving side by finding code solutions while also being able to flex my creative design muscles--it’s the best of both worlds. If you’re as passionate about good UX design and want to learn more about me, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.</h4>
